##  Why is Steroids Cool?

### Multiple WebViews with Native Transitions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Steroids handles all the hard stuff for you. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Cross-platform from the get go. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
1) Steroids allows you to create multiple WebViews that you can switch between using native transitions, creating a much smoother app experience

2) Steroids doesn't require you to use any other software to compile, test, and deploy your apps. It's all handled by Steroids' magical command-line interface

3) Apps built with Steroids work on iOS and Android from the get go. Through a single codebase you'll be able to test and deploy on multiple platforms
